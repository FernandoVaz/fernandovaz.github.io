# Introduction
Markdown is the language that is rendered into HTML by Jekyll and other services (Like Github Readme.MD). It is a simple language to put labels in elements so it translates to other HTML elements. This Cheat Sheet will help you remember some stuff that might not be easy to memorize, and in my personal opinion you should'nt unless you write a lot.
